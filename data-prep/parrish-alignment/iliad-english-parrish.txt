1. Sing , goddess , the godlike wrath of Achilles , son of Peleus
2. that sociopathic wrath that caused countless pains for the Achaeans
3. and hurled to Hades many precious lives
4. of warriors , and began to make their bodies into picked-over scraps for dogs
5. and for birds , all of them ; and the plan of Zeus began to be fulfilled
6. from the point where  first , the two having both begun a competition with each other , both of them faced off
7. the son of Atreus , lord of men , and god-like Achilles
8. Who  then of the gods threw together the two of them to fight in competition with one another
9. The son of Leto and of Zeus : for that one , filled with anger at the king
10. set in motion an evil sickness up through the camp . And the soldiers began to be killed
11. because he showed disrespect to that man Chryses , the god-talker
12. What man? -- the son of Atreus . Here is what happened: a man , came to the swift ships of the Achaeans
13. in order to free  his daughter and bearing boundless ransom
14. holding the wreaths of the far-shooter Apollo in his hands
15. high up on his golden staff . And he began to plead with all the Achaeans
16. and especially with the two sons of Atreus , the organizers of the soldiers
17. “Sons of Atreus and also all the well-greaved Achaeans
18. with my blessing may the gods , having homes on Olympus , confer gift on you
19. to sack utterly the city of Priam , and to return homewards well
20. but for me free my beloved child , and accept this ransom
21. showing reverence for the son of Zeus , the far-shooter Apollo
22. At that point indeed all the Achaeans shouted their approval
23. both to treat with decency the sacrifice-leader and to accept the shining ransom
24. However , this was not sweet to Atreus’ son , Agamemnon , in his heart
25. Instead , he dismissed him cruelly . He began to impose a harsh command
26. “May (emphasizing with tone and body language the pronoun “I”) I not come upon you , old man , near the hollow ships
27. either hanging around now or returning back later
28. lest even at that time the staff and wreaths of the god may not protect you
29. that woman  (again, emphasizing with tone and body language the pronoun “I”) I will not free , until (Agamemnon emphasizes the next two words as a taunt) old age comes upon her
30. in our house in Argos , far from her fatherland
31. working the loom and serving my bed
32. Instead go away ! Do not provoke me thus so that you might return more safely than if you remain
33. So he spoke . The old man became frightened . And he began to obey the command
34. He walked  in silence to the shore of the loudly-roaring sea
35. And then , going far away , that old man as god-talker began speaking to
36. lord Apollo , he whom light-haired Leto bore
37. “Hear me , silver-bowed one , you who stands guard over Chrysa
38. and sacred Cilla , and are lord of Tenedos by force
39. Smintheus , if at any time I roofed over a shrine pleasing to you
40. or if  at any time I completely burned fat thigh-bones for you
41. of bulls and of goats , fulfill this  wish for me
42. may the Danaans pay their respects to my tears with your arrows
43. So he spoke praying . Phoebus Apollo listened to that man
44. Seething with anger in his heart , he came  down from the top of Olympus
45. carrying his bow and his covered quiver on his shoulders
46. The arrows rattled noisily  on the shoulders of the god as he seethed with anger
47. once he himself began to move . That one  made his way like night
48. Then he began to crouch far away from the ships . He fired an arrow in their midst
49. Fearsome was the rattle from the silver bow
50. First he began to go after the mules and the swift dogs
51. but then , letting fly a sharp arrow against the men themselves
52. he began to strike . The pyres of the corpses , one after another , were kept burning without any break
53. For nine days , to start with , the arrows of the god kept moving up through the camp
54. On the tenth day , however , Achilles summoned the soldiers to an assembly
55. The white-armed goddess Hera , as it happened , placed this within that man’s mind
56. This was the reason : she kept worrying about the Danaans , because  she kept watching them as they died
57. After those  were assembled and so were gathered together
58. swift-footed Achilles , standing up , spoke among them
59. “Son of Atreus , now I believe that we , driven back
60. will return to our homes again - if death , we might flee at all
61. If truly war and plague together will force the Achaeans into submission
62. Instead , come , let us ask either some seer or sacrifice-leader
63. or even a dream-interpreter , for  a dream is also from Zeus
64. That man may say why Phoebus Apollo became so greatly filled with anger
65. whether  he reproaches us on account of a vow or a sacrifice
66. or if he in any way , having met with the rich aroma of fully-grown sheep and goats
67. would be willing to avert destruction from us
68.  Having spoken thus , that man sat down : among them stood up
69. Calchas , son of Thestor , best by far of all the bird-interpreters
70. who knew the things that are , and the things that will be , and the things that were before
71. and who had led the ships of the Achaeans into Troy
72. through his own gift of foresight , which Phoebus Apollo gave to him
73. That man , thinking benevolently for them , addressed the assembly , and spoke in their midst
74. “Achilles , beloved of Zeus , you order me to explain
75. the wrath of Apollo , the lord far-shooter
76. therefore (Calchas emphasizes the “I” with his intonation and body language) I will speak . And as for you , take this in and swear to me
77. most decidedly that to help me with determination , with your words and with your hands
78. For I truly expect to fill with anger a man , he who greatly
79. holds power over all the Argives , and whom the Achaeans obey
80. for the king has more power , whenever he is angry at an inferior man
81. Here’s the reason:  even if , in fact , he would choke down his anger on that one particular day
82. nevertheless just as certainly going forward he holds a grudge in his chest , until he can fulfill it
83. So , as for you , make yourself clear , if you will protect me
84. Swift-footed Achilles , answering , addressed that man
85. “Having taken heart fully , give voice to the god’s message , whatever it is you know
86. For by Apollo , beloved of Zeus , and for whom you , Calchas
87. speaking with authority , reveal divine messages to the Danaans
88. no one , with me living and able to see upon this earth
89. will bear upon you heavy hands near the hollow ships
90. not any of all the Danaans together , not even if you are speaking about Agamemnon
91. he who boasts to be by far the best of the Achaeans
92.  Then  he took courage and he began to speak , the blameless prophet
93. “ Indeed that one finds fault neither with a vow nor a sacrifice
94. but rather , because of the god-talker , the man to whom Agamemnon showed disrespect
95. he did not  free his daughter , nor did he accept the ransom
96.  Because of this the far-shooter gave sufferings and he will continue to give still
97. That one certainly will not  first drive off shameful destruction for the Danaans
98. before you give back the bright-eyed girl to her beloved father
99. without a price , without a ransom , and lead a holy sacrifice
100. to Chrysa : then we , having appeased him , might cause a change of heart
101. That man , having spoken thus , sat down  : Then among them stood up
102. the warrior son of Atreus , wide-ruling Agamemnon
103. stricken with pain . His black heart completely
104. begin being filled with rage . His two eyes became like blazing fire
105. Glaring evilly first of all at Calchas , he spoke
106. “Seer of evil things , you have never yet once said a favorable thing to me
107. these evil things are always dear to you in your heart to prophesy
108. and as for the fortunate , you never yet spoke any word nor accomplished anything
109. And now , speaking on behalf of the gods , you declare among the Danaans
110. that , that the far-shooter produces sufferings for them because of this particular thing
111. because I, for my part , was not willing to accept the shining ransom of the girl Chryseis
112. , since I very much wish to hold that particular woman
113. at home . And in fact  I have come to prefer her over Clytemnestra
114. my lawful wife , since she is not inferior to her
115. not in form , nor in stature , nor  in mind , nor in any respect in the things that she can produce
116. Yet even so I am willing to give her back , if this really is better
117. I, for my part , wish the soldiers to be safe , rather than to be wiped out
118. As for me , prepare a prize appropriate for my rank immediately , so that alone
119. of the Argives I am not without a prize , since this is also not fitting
120. After all , each and every one of you see this , don’t you - that my prize goes elsewhere
121. And then swift-footed godly Achilles proceeded to answer him
122. “Son of Atreus , the man with the most glory , and most attached to possessions of all
123. how exactly will the Achaeans , great-hearted give you a prize
124. We do not  know of great common stores lying around anywhere at all
125. Rather , as we all know , the things which we sacked from the cities , these things have been handed out
126. and on the other hand it would also not be fitting for the soldiers to gather together again these clawed-back things things
127. Instead , you for your part now release this girl to the god . On our part , the Achaeans
128. will repay you three times , and even four times, over , if Zeus at some point
129. may confer the gift to sack completely the well-walled city Troy
130. And answering , the ruler Agamemnon addressed that man
131. “Do not  in this way - although being skillful , godlike Achilles
132. cheat with your mind , since you will not slip past nor persuade me
133. Do you really want - while you yourself are to hold onto your own prize - me , for my part , like this
134. to sit still without having one ? Are you telling me to give back this particular woman
135.  Mind you , if the great-hearted Achaeans will give me a prize
136. having fashioned it exactly according to my heart , so that it will be worth just as much … (Agamemnon uses non-verbal communication -- perhaps a shrug of the shoulders -- to communicate that this would be acceptable)
137. But, if they should not make a gift , then I myself , going in person would take possession for myself
138. either your prize or that of Ajax , or that of Odysseus
139. Having taken position , I will lead it away . That man  will be angry and stay angry , whomever I would approach
140. That said,  certainly we will return to consider once again these things
141. Now , come . Let us drag a black ship into the divine sea
142. Let us gather within sufficient rowers . A sacrifice
143. let us place inside . The beautiful-cheeked Chryseis herself
144. we will embark . And let some single counsel-bearing man be the leader
145. either Ajax or Idomeneus or godlike Odysseus
146. or you , Son of Peleus , most outrageous of all men
147. unti , having performed sacrifices , you will appease him , the free-worker
148. Having given dark look  swift-footed Achilles addressed that man
149. “How dare you! You , all clothed in indecency , obsessed by profit
150. how would any of the Achaeans with determination listen to your words
151. either to go on a journey or with his own strength to fight with men
152. That is to be expected : I certainly did not come on account of Trojan spearmen
153. here in order to fight , since they are not at fault to me in any way
154. for they did not ever drive away my cattle , nor  my horses
155. nor in warrior-nourishing , fertile Phthia did they ever
156. harm the harvest , since there are many things between
157. many  shady mountains and also the roaring sea
158. Instead you , oh unbelievably indecent one , together we followed so that you might rejoice
159. seeking to gain respect for Menelaus and for you , dog-face
160. from the Trojans . Of these things you do not consider at all . Nor do you give a damn
161. And now you make make threats that you yourself to seize for yourself my prize
162. for which I struggled at length , and which the sons of the Achaeans gave to me
163. Certainly I never have a prize equal to yours , whenever the Achaeans
164. sack and pillage a well-managed city of the Trojans
165. Instead , you may be sure , the greater part of the miserable fighting
166. my hands perform ; nevertheless whenever the division of spoils is at hand
167. for you the prize is much greater , while a smaller yet precious prize I for my part
168. go on my way carrying upon the ships , after I am exhausted from waging war
169. But now I will go to Phthia , since it is surely much superior
170. to go home with the curved ships . With me being disrespected here , I do not plan
171. to ladle out riches and wealth for you
172. And then the lord of men , Agamemnon , began to answer him
173. “By all means run away , if your heart is stirred in that direction . I, for one, certainly , do not
174. plead with you to stay on account of me : beside me, you can be sure , are others as well
175. who will respect me -- and most of all , Zeus , the giver of counsel
176. You are the most hateful  to me of the kings fostered by Zeus
177. for competing with others is always dear to you , as are both wars and battles
178. If you are very strong , at some point a god gave this  to you
179. Going home with both your own ships and with your own comrades
180. lord it over the Myrmidons . And as for me , I don’t give a damn about you
181. nor do I worry about you bearing a grudge . But I will make the following threat to you
182. as Phoebus Apollo is taking away for himself from me Chryseis
183. that woman , you can be sure , I will send on her way with both my own ship and my own comrades
184. For my part , however, I will lead beautiful-cheeked Briseis
185. that  prize of yours , going myself to your resting-place , so that you will clearly see
186. how greatly I am superior to you , and another man as well will fear
187. to declare himself an equal to me , and to treat himself as a peer to my face
188. So he spoke . And pain materialized in the son of Peleus . The heart
189. in his hairy chest was torn in two directions
190. whether HE having drawn for himself the sharp sword from beside his thigh
191. would  make the men stand back while he for his part would kill the son of Atreus
192. or he could stop his anger and restrain his heart
193. As he was turning over these things through his thoughts and through his heart
194. he was beginning to pull for himself  from his sheath a great sword , but Athena came
195. from heaven . The reason for this was that the white-armed goddess Hera sent her forth
196. both caring about and concerned for the two men equally in her heart
197. She stood  behind him , and by his light hair she gripped the son of Peleus
198. making herself visible to him alone . None of the others  could see
199. Achilles was astonished  , and turned himself around . And right then and there he recognized
200. Pallas Athena . and her two eyes appeared terrifying
201.  Having addressed her , he began to give voice to winged words
202. “There you are ! Why , daughter of aegis-holding Zeus , have you come
203. Is it  so that you might see for yourself the outrageous behavior of Agamemnon , son of Atreus
204. Whatever the answer I will tell you something . And this as well I expect to be fulfilled
205. by his outrageous actions soon he will destroy his life
206. Then to him the goddess spoke , owl-eyed Athena
207. “I, for part , came in order to stop this rage of yours -- if you might obey
208. down from the heavens . The white-armed goddess Hera sent me forth
209. both caring about and concerned for both equally in her heart
210. Instead , come on . Step away from this quarrel . Do not keep drawing for yourself the sword in your hand
211. Instead , by all means , with words as much as you please paint him a nasty picture of how he can be sure it will be
212. Because I will tell you how this is is . And as well this will in reality be fulfilled
213. In the future , there will be present in your possession three times as many shining gifts
214. because of the outrageous behavior that we see here . As for you , hold yourself back . Listen to to us
215. And , replying , swift-footed Achilles said to her
216. “Of course , goddess , it is necessary to heed a statement from the two of you
217. even though really filled up with anger in one’s heart . For it is better this way
218. Whoever obeys the gods , they really  listen to that man
219. He spoke . And on the silver hilt he held his heavy hand
220. Back into the sheath he shoved the great sword , and he did not disobey
221. the command of Athena . But as for that goddess , she had already departed to Olympus
222. into the home of aegis-holding Zeus among the other divinities
223. The son of Peleus  yet again with harsh words
224. spoke to the son of Atreus . And he was not yet stepping away from his anger
225. “Swollen with wine , having the eyes of a dog but the heart of a deer
226. never to arm yourself for battle together with the army
227. nor ever to enter an ambush  with the most outstanding of the Achaeans
228. have you had the fortitude in your heart . That seems to you to be death
229. Surely it is much more preferable along the broad camp of the Achaeans
230. to take away for yourself gifts from whoever may have speak against you
231. You are a king who devours his people , since you lord over nobodies
232. For truly , son of Atreus , you would now have acted abusively for the last time
233. Instead I will explain to you , and besides I will swear a great oath
234. Truly by this very staff , which never in truth will sprout leaves and branches
235. after  it first left behind its stump in the mountains
236. nor will it flourish again . For the bronze stripped it all around
237. both the leaves and the bark . Now , however , the sons of the Achaeans
238. acting as judges , carry it in their palms , they who
239.  defend the laws on behalf of Zeus . This  will be a great oath to you
240. In the future certainly a desire for Achilles will come upon the sons of the Achaeans
241. each and every one of them ! And then you , though stricken with pain , will not have the power
242. to provide protection in the least , when many fall dying at the hands of Hector the man-slaughterer
243. You  will gouge open your own heart within
244. consumed with fury because you showed respect to in no way the best of the Achaeans
245. So spoke the son of Peleus . And he flung against the ground the staff
246. drilled with golden studs . And he himself began to sit
247. And the son of Atreus from the other side continued in wrath . And among them Nestor
248. pleasing in speech lept up , the articulate assembly-speaker of the Pylians
249. and from that man’s tongue speech began to flow , sweeter than honey
250. Already for him already two generations of mortal men
251. had passed away , who previously along with him were raised and born
252. in most holy Pylos . And now , he was lord among the third generation
253. He , thinking constructively for them , addressed the assembly and spoke in their midst
254. “I can’t believe it ! For sure great sorrow has reached the Achaean land
255. You can be sure Priam would rejoice , as would the children of Priam
256. while the other Trojans would filled with pleasure greatly in their hearts
257. if they should hear about all these things here , about the two of you fighting
258. you who are above  the Danaans in planning , and above in fighting
259. Stop it! Listen to me ! - the two of you both  are younger than I am
260. For as for me , already at times , with men even better than you both
261. spent my time . And not once would those men , you may be sure dismiss me
262. 227425 Let me tell you , never have I seen , nor would I see with my own eyes , such men
263. such as Peirithous and Dryas , the shepherd of the soldiers
264. and Caeneus and Exadius and also godlike Polyphemus
265. and the son of Aegeus’ son , Theseus , a man like the immortals
266. those were brought up as the mightiest  of the men on earth
267. Let me make this point clear : they were the mightiest . And they would fight against the mightiest
268. against mountain-dwelling centaurs . And utterly they annihilated them
269. First , I used to spend my time among those men , having come from Pylos
270. from far away , from a distant land . Why did I come? Because  called for me
271. And I would fight on my own with my own two hands - I did that ! And let me make this point clear as well , with those men (gesturing in the distance to emphasize the separation from the present)  no one of those
272. who are now mortals on this earth could put up a fight
273. But you may be sure , they paid attention to my plans and they would listen to my recommendations
274. And so now , listen to me -- and I mean you (plural, addressing Agamemnon and Achilles both) ! -- because to listen is better
275. As for you (singular, addressing Agamemnon) , high-ranking though you are - do not take away for yourself the girl from this man here
276. Instead , leave it just as at first the sons of Achaeans gave the prize to him
277. And as for you , do not , son of Peleus , choose to compete with a king
278. pitting your strength against his , since
279. a staff-holding king , to whom  Zeus gave renown never has received possession of a position of respect that is comparable
280. If  you are stronger , a goddess  as mother bore you
281. nevertheless he still is superior since he is lord over more people
282. Son of Atreus , as for you , stop your rage : look ! I, for my part
283. I beg you to let go of your anger towards Achilles , he who to all
284. the Achaeans is a great defense in cruel war
285. And , answering him , ruling Agamemnon spoke
286. “2274266 Sure enough , you said all these things  rightly , old man
287. But this man here wishes to be above all others
288. Not only does he desire to be stronger than everyone , but also to be lord over everyone
289. and to give orders to everyone . As far as these things are concerned , I don’t expect anyone to listen
290. If  the gods , existing always , made him a spearman
291. for that reason do they allow him to publicly deliver insults
292. But then , interrupting , godlike Achilles began to answer him
293. “Surely  I would be called both a coward and a nobody
294. if  I will yield to you in each action , whatever you might say
295. To other men , for all I care , make these commands . Because , to me, you can be sure , don’t
296. give any orders . In fact I, for my part , do not expect to listen to you in the future
297. And I will tell you another thing . You for your part , deposit it into your heart
298. indeed I will not fight against  you with my hands on account of the girl
299. not with you , not with any other man -- since you (pl) , having given her , now take her away for yourselves from me
300. But as for the other things , which are in my possession beside the swift black ship
301. of these things you may not carry away anything , having picked it up with me unwilling
302. But come on - really , try for yourself , so that these men here as well may learn
303. your dark blood will pour out right then and there around my spear
304. Thus the two of them  , having fought with such opposing speeches
305. they stood up , and they dismissed the assembly beside the ships of the Achaeans
306. The son of Peleus , on the one hand , went on his way towards the resting-places and the well-balanced ships
307. with both the son of Menoetius and his comrades
308. Meanwhile , the son of Atreus  dragged forward a swift ship to the sea
309. And therein he selected twenty rowers . And a sacrifice
310. for the god he embarked , and up into the ship
311. he , leading , seated the beautiful-cheeked Chryseis . And in went as leader the adaptable Odysseus
312. Then they , or on their side , having embarked , began to sail over the watery routes
313. while the son of Atreus commanded the soldiers to purify themselves
314. Those  began purifying themselves . And they flinging the impurities into the sea
315. Then they began to perform potent sacrifices for Apollo
316. of bulls and of goats , along the shore of the barren sea
317. and the aroma reached the heavens , swirling about in the smoke
318. In this way they  began working on these things down throughout the camp . But , Agamemnon was not
319. stepping away from the competition which he first threatened against Achilles
320. Instead he  spoke to both Talthybius and Eurybates
321. those two who were his heralds and ready attendants
322. “You two go to the resting-place of Peleus’ son , Achilles
323. After seizing beautiful-cheeked Briseis by the hand , bring her
324. If  he should not give her , then I myself person would seize her for myself
325. having come with an more men . And for him that will be more to be feared
326. Having spoken thus , he sent them forth . He imposed the cruel command
327. the two , unwilling , both walked along the shore of the barren sea
328. The two of them arrived at both the resting-places and the ships of the Myrmidons
329. That man they found beside both his resting-place and his black ship
330. sitting . Nor did Achilles rejoice at all having caught sight of those two
331. On the one hand , the two men , terrified at , and feeling shame before , the king
332. stood there . but They did not begin to address him about anything nor did they ask any questions
333. For his part that man understood the situation in his heart and spoke
334. “Welcome , heralds , messengers of Zeus and also of men
335. Come closer . Don’t worry, you are not to be responsible to me for anything : instead Agamemnon is
336. the one who sent you two forth on account of the girl Briseis
337. (Achilles turns to Patroclus) Come , Zeus-born Patroclus , bring out the girl
338. and give her to these two to lead away . And let these two themselves be witnesses
339. both before the blessed gods and before mortal people
340. and before that unfeeling king , if some day  again
341. need of me should arise to defend against shameful destruction
342. for those others . For surely he is out of control , with a self-destructive heart
343.  He does not at all understand how to plan for the future and the past together
344. so that the Achaeans might in the future fight besides the ships , safe under his watch
345. So he spoke , and Patroclus began to obey his beloved companion
346.  he led the beautiful-cheeked Bryseis out of the resting-place
347. and he gave her to lead away . The two of them  went back along the ships of the Achaeans
348. and that person , the woman , unwilling , started on her way along with those people . As for Achilles
349. having started to cry , he at once took a seat far away from his companions , sinking down
350. upon the shore of the gray saltwater and gazing out upon the boundless sea
351. And he  at length as god-talker spoke to to his beloved mother , stretching out his hands
352. “Mother , since you did after all give birth to me , although being destined for a short life
353. a position commanding appropriate respect , at the very least , the Olympian ought to extend to me
354. Zeus thundering on high . But now not even a little did he show respect to me
355. That is clearly the case because , in truth , the son of Atreus , wide-ruling Agamemnon
356. has shown disrespect to me . For , having snatched my prize , he holds it -- he himself having stolen it
357. So he spoke , shedding tears . That man his revered mother heard
358. sitting in the depths of the sea beside her father , an old man
359. Swiftly  she rose up from the gray sea like the mist
360. and  before that man , with him shedding tears , she sat down
361. With her hand she caressed him and she also spoke , and began speaking to him by name
362. “2274312 Son , why are you crying ? What  sorrow reached your heart
363. Speak out -- do not conceal it in your mind ! -- so that we both might know
364. Groaning deeply , he answered her  , the swift-footed Achilles
365. “You know - why then should I list all these things to you , who already know
366. We made our way into Thebes , the sacred city of Eetion
367. That city we sacked from one end to the other , and we also led everything here
368. And while these things the sons of the Achaeans divided up well among themselves
369. And they took out the beautiful-cheeked daughter of Chryses for the son of Atreus
370. But then Chryses , the sacrifice-leader of the far-shooter Apollo
371. came to the swift ships of the bronze-wearing Achaeans
372. in order to free  his daughter , bearing  boundless ransom
373. holding the wreaths of the far-shooter Apollo in his hands
374. aloft on his golden staff . And he began to plead with all the Achaeans
375. and especially with the two sons of Atreus , the organizers of the soldiers
376. At that point indeed all the other Achaeans responded approvingly
377. both to treat with decency the sacrifice-leader and to accept the shining ransom
378. However , this was not sweet to the son of Atreus , Agamemnon , in his heart
379. Instead, he dismissed him cruelly . He began to impose upon him a harsh command
380.  The old man , seething with anger , made his way back . and to him , after he had begun his prayer
381. Apollo listened , because Chryses was very dear to him
382. And he fired an evil arrow against the Argives . Now those soldiers
383. one after another , kept dying . And those arrows of the god kept flying in
384. on every side up through the wide camp of the Achaeans . To us  the prophet
385. thinking benevolently , began to publicly deliver the prophecies of the far-shooter
386. Immediately I was the one who first began to urge that we should appease the god
387. But then anger took hold of the son of Atreus , Instantly after standing up
388. he gave a threatening command , which  has been brought to completion
389. Here is what I mean : that woman , to begin with , the quick-eyed Achaeans with a swift ship
390. send to Chryses , At the same time , they bring gifts for the lord
391. But this other woman just now the heralds went on their way , leading her away from my resting-place
392. the daughter of Briseus , the woman whom the sons of the Achaeans gave to me
393. But if you really have the power , protect your noble son
394. Having gone to Olympus , plead with Zeus , if at any time  in any way
395. either by what you have said or in fact by what you have done you cheered the heart of Zeus
396. For often in the great rooms of your father I have heard you
397. boasting , when you stated that for black-clouded son of Cronos
398. you alone among the immortals fought off shameful destruction
399. when the other Olympians wished to tie him up
400. both Hera and Poseidon and even Pallas Athena
401. But you , goddess , having come , released that one from his chains
402. having immediately called the hundred-handed one into great Olympus
403. he whom the gods call Briareus , and all men
404. Aegaeon . For that one , in turn , is better than his father in terms of physical strength
405. He then sat down beside the son of Cronos , basking in his aura of power
406. And before him they cowered the blessed gods . So they did not still tie him up
407. Now , having reminded him of these things , sit at his side and take hold of his knees
408. if somehow he might be willing to bring aid upon the Trojans
409. and to squeeze together the Achaeans both down among their ships’ decks , and around the sea
410. as they are killed , so that all may enjoy the full benefit of their king
411. and the son of Atreus , widely-ruling Agamemnon , also may recognize
412. his own self-destructive stupidity , in that he showed no respect to the best of the Achaeans
413. And Thetis , pouring down tears , then began to answer him
414. “(sighing deeply) My son , why did I take the time to raise you - I , after bearing you for awful things
415. I wish you might be able , beside the ships , without tears and without suffering
416. to remain quietly ! since , even now , the fate assigned to you is brief as it is , is not very long at all
417. But now , you are , simultaneously , both doomed to die soon and unhappy beyond all people
418. So it was for an evil destiny that I gave birth to you in the great rooms
419. To present this  statement for you to Zeus , who delights in thunderbolt
420. I , in person , will go to snow-covered Olympus in the hopes that he may be persuaded
421. But as for you , now sitting beside the swift-sailing ships
422. continue in wrath against the Achaeans . Put a stop to your actions away from war completely
423. For Zeus yesterday went into Oceanus to the midst of the blameless Ethiopians
424. on account of a feast All the gods began to follow along
425. But on the twelfth day he will come back again to Olympus
426. And at that time , then on your behalf I will go to the bronze-floored house of Zeus
427. and I will clasp him by his knees . And I expect to make my case successfully to him
428. Having spoken thus  she went away . That one  she left then and there
429. filled with anger throughout his heart because of the well-girdled woman
430. she whom  they were stealing by force with him being unwilling . As for Odysseus
431. he was on his way to Chrysa , bringing a sacred sacrifice
432. When they   entered within the very deep harbor
433. first they took in their sails , then they placed them in the black ship
434. Then they guided the mast to the mast-holder having lowered it with ropes
435. quickly . With oars they rowed it forward into the anchoring-area
436. And out they cast the anchors . They tied down the boat’s stern-cables
437. As for the men themselves they made their way out at the edge of the sea
438. They disembarked the sacrifice for the far-shooter Apollo
439. And out of the sea-faring ship Chryseis walked
440. And then at that point Odysseus , a man of many counsels , leading her up to the altar
441. put her in her beloved father’s hands . And he spoke to him
442. “ Chryses , the lord of men sent me forth , Agamemnon
443. both to lead your child to you and to perform a sacred sacrifice for Phoebus
444. on behalf of the Danaans , so that we may appease the lord
445. he who now has set in motion grievous troubles to the Argives
446. Having spoken in this way , he placed her in his hands .2274355a And that man , rejoicing , received
447. his beloved daughter . Quickly the sacred sacrifice for the  god
448. they made stand in a row about the well-built altar
449. Then they purified their hands with water and picked up in their hands ground barley
450. Then among them Chryses , having raised his hands , began to pray loudly
451. “Listen to me , silver-bowed one , you who encircled Chrysa
452. and sacred Cilla , and are lord of Tenedos by force
453. Just as certainly  once before you listened to me when I had prayed
454. and just as certainly you conferred respect upon me , at you also greatly harmed the soldiers of the Achaeans
455. And still even now , for me fulfill in addition the following wish
456. Right this minute , now , drive way shameful destruction from the Danaans
457. So he spoke , praying , and Phoebus Apollo listened to him
458. But then after they prayed and cast forth the ground barley
459. they first pulled back  the heads of the offerings , and then slaughtered and flayed them
460. They cut away the thighs  and wrapped up and down them in fat
461. having made it double-folded . Then they placed raw meat on top of the thigh pieces themselves
462. The old man began to burn them on skewers . Then he began to pour flashing wine on
463. The young men  next to him were holding five-pronged forks in their hands
464. After a while when the thigh pieces were burned thoroughly and they tasted the organs
465. they began to cut up  the rest and also pierced them with spits through both sides
466. they skillfully roasted  them , and pulled off for themselves everything
467. After a while , when they stopped themselves from work and prepared for themselves the feast
468. they kept sharing the feast , nor was their heart lacking in any way from the evenly-divided feast
469. After a while , when they rid themselves of the desire for drink and for food
470. the young men first for themselves they filled to the brim mixing-bowls with drink
471. then they distributed  this to everyone , having made the initial libations with the drinking-cups
472. Those men  throughout the entire day continued to appease the god through song and dance
473. the elite young men of the Achaeans singing the beautiful song to Apollo
474. celebrating with song the far-shooter . And that one , listening , was pleased in his heart
475. And when the sun sank and dusk arrived
476. then  they lay themselves down to sleep beside the stern-cables of the ship
477. And when early-born , rosy-fingered Dawn appeared
478. right at that time then they began bringing themselves back to the midst of the broad camp of the Achaeans
479. For them  the far-shooter Apollo set in motion a favorable wind
480. And as for those men , they stood up for themselves the mast and spread high and wide the white sails
481. Wind swelled the sail in its center . And on both sides a wave
482. surging , was splashing against the front of the ship , as it travelled
483. And that ship , making time through its path , kept running over the wave
484. And then , after  they arrived at the broad camp of the Achaeans
485. first they pulled the black ship onto land
486. far up upon the sandy shore , and then they laid out the long supports underneath
487. Then the men themselves began to scatter throughout both the resting-places and
488. Meanwhile that man remained filled with wrath , sitting alongside his swift-sailing ships
489. the descendent of Zeus , son of Peleus , swift-footed Achilles
490. Neither did he ever resume his habit of entering into the assembly that brings glory to men
491. nor into war . Instead he kept wearing and wearing away his beloved heart
492. remaining right where he was . He kept longing and longing for both the battle-shout and war
493. However   from that point , when the twelfth dawn took place
494. then   the gods , existing always , went to Olympus
495. all of them at the same time . Zeus was leading the way . Thetis  was not forgetful of the demands
496. of her own son - Far from it : that woman rose up over a wave of the sea
497. In the early morning  she went up to great heaven and Olympus
498. She found  the far-seeing son of Cronos sitting apart from the others
499. on the highest summit of many-peaked Olympus
500. And so then she sat down before Zeus himself , and she laid hold of his knees
501. with her left hand , and  with her right hand she gripped beneath his chin
502. pleading with him , she addressed the lord Zeus , son of Cronos
503. “Father Zeus , if at any time  I among the immortals helped you
504. either by word or by deed , fulfill this wish for me
505. treat my son with proper respect , he who was doomed to the most swift death of others
506. Instead , now  the lord of men Agamemnon
507. has shown disrespect to him . For he , having snatched his prize , holds it -- he himself having stolen it
508. Instead you for your part , I beg you , show proper respect for him , all-wise Olympian Zeus
509. so long  place in the possession the Trojans superior strength , until the Achaeans
510. show proper respect to my son and glorify him with a position of respect
511. So she spoke , and he did not address her at all , Zeus the cloud-summoner
512. Rather , in silence he remained motionless for a long time . And as Thetis took hold for herself his knees
513. in this way she kept holding herself on , having attached herself on him . And again a second time she began to petition him
514. “Promise most faithfully to me , and nod your head in approval
515. or refuse , since for you fear does not exist , so that I may know well
516. how greatly I am the most disrespected goddess among all
517. That woman  , he answered , greatly agitated , , Zeus the cloud-summoner
518. “Without a doubt  these deeds are destructive , since you will push me to stir up a fight
519. Hera , when she would torment me with insulting words
520. And  to be sure in the same manner , among the immortal gods , with me always
521. she picks fights . And she even claims that I support the Trojans in battle
522. But as for you , first , go back now , lest she should become aware of anything
523. Hera . Then these things will be an an object of concern for me until I am completely finished with it
524. But come - I will nod my approval to you with my head so that you may have settled confidence
525. As you know , this from me is truly the greatest sign among the immortals
526. for mine is not to be taken back , nor something that can deceive
527. nor can it go unfulfilled -- whatever I may nod my approval to with my head
528. He spoke , And with his dark brows , he gave the nod of approval , the son of Cronos
529. And  his divine hair flowed down from the lord’s
530. immortal head . And he shook great Olympus
531. Then the two , having planned together in this way , separated . Then , she , for her part
532. lept from glittering Olympus into the deep sea
533. while Zeus went to his own home . All the gods stood up at the same time
534. from their seats in front of their father ; not one of them had the nerve
535. to stay in their place as he was approaching . Instead facing him in greeting , they stood -- each and every one of them
536. So there indeed he sat down on his throne . But Hera , when she had seen him , did not
537. fail to understand that she had fashioned plans together with him
538. silver-footed Thetis , the daughter of the old man of the sea
539. Right then and there with cutting words she began to address Zeus , the son of Cronos
540. “Who  of the gods fashioned plans together with you , devious one , this time
541. It is always dear to you being far away from me
542. thinking secret things to pass judgment on . To me have you not yet
543. with determination dared to give expression to whatever you may have in mind
544.  Then he began to answer her , the father of both men and of gods
545. “Hera , do not  expect to know all my decisions
546. they will be too difficult for you , despite being my wife
547. This is how it is . Of course , whatever  is fitting to hear , then not anyone
548. neither any of the gods nor of humans will know that decision before you
549. But, that said , whatever decision I, for my part , might choose to think through separately from the gods
550. Do not in any way as for, you, for your part - do not in any way pose questions about or inquire after each and every one of these things
551. Then  she began to answer him , the ox-eyed , revered Hera
552. “You are the worst , son of Cronos , what sort of command was that which you said
553.  Up until now indeed I neither question you constantly , nor do I make inquiries
554. But you , very much at-ease , plan these things however you should choose
555. And now I am filled with fear horribly down through my heart , that she may have convinced you
556. silver-footed Thetis , daughter of the old man of the sea
557. For in the early morning she seated herself beside you and took hold of your knees
558. To her , I think that you actually nodded in approval so that
559. you would show respect to Achilles , and you would destroy many of the Achaeans beside the ships
560. Answering , cloud-summoner Zeus addressed her
561. “You are out of your mind ! You always  are calculating . And never do I slip past you
562. All the same , you will not be able to accomplish anything . Instead from my heart
563. you will be much more distant . And this will be even more to be feared by you
564. If  this is the way things are , this is going to be pleasing to me
565. Instead , sit in silence ! Obey my command
566. or else however many gods that are in Olympus now would not protect you
567. from me , coming close , when I would set invincible hands in motion against you
568. So he spoke . And she became frightened , the ox-eyed , revered Hera
569. So in silence she sat down , clamping down on her beloved heart
570. Throughout the house of Zeus the heavenly gods were made upset
571. Among them  Hephaestus , celebrated for his ability to make things , began to speak to the group
572. conveying pleasing things to his beloved mother , white-armed Hera
573. “Without a doubt  these deeds will be destructive , and they will not be tolerable any longer
574. if  you two quarrel in this way because of mortals
575. and stir up a brawl among the gods . Nor will there be any
576. enjoyment of this good feast , since the worse win
577. To my mother I for my part give this advice  , even though she can think for herself
578. to convey pleasing things to my beloved father Zeus , so that
579. my father would not fight again and disturb the feast along with us
580. For there is indeed the possibility that the Olympian of lightning would choose
581. to shove us out of our seats . That one , as we all know , is the one who can generate the most force by far
582. Instead , you on your end , for your own benefit caress that man with soft words
583. Immediately then the Olympian will be gracious to us
584. He spoke  thus . And , having lept up
585. he placed a two-handled cup in his dear mother’s hand . And he spoke to her
586. “Be strong , my mother . And hold yourself up , although being troubled
587. lest you , beloved as you are I may see in my eyes
588. being beaten . And then I will not be able , though stricken with pain
589. to offer protection in any way . As you know , the Olympian is very hard to set oneself against
590. For before now , also at another time as I was attempting to defend you
591. he flung me , having seized my foot , down from the divine threshold
592. Throughout the entire day I was propelled . Along with  the setting sun
593. I ended my downward fall on Lemnos . But still a little spirit was still present within
594. There the Sintian men straight away took care of me , after having fallen
595. So he spoke . And white-armed goddess Hera smiled
596. And , after having smiled , she accepted from her child the cup in her hand
597. As for him , that one , starting from the left and moving to the right , for all the other gods
598. began to pour out wine , drawing sweet nectar out of the mixing-bowl
599. Laughter too loud to be drowned out  then was stirred up among the blessed gods
600. as they saw Hephaestus bustling through the house
601. Then in this manner all day , until the sun had set
602. they kept sharing the feast . Neither was their heart lacking anything of the equally-divided feast
603. nor indeed of the outstandingly beautiful lyre , which Apollo was holding
604. nor of the Muses , who were singing , taking turns , with a beautiful voice
605. And then , after the shining light of the sun sank down
606. the rest of them  each went to their home in order to lie down
607. where for each the widely-renowned and crippled in both feet
608. Hephaestus made a house , with his knowing mind
609. And Olympian Zeus , god of lightning , made his way to his bed
610. There formerly he used to rest himself when sweet sleep might come to him
611. There , having ascended , he lay down to sleep . And at his side was golden-throned Hera
